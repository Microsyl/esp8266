This sketch will connect api.thingspeak.com and update field1 in a channel with current millis() value
Configuration is done via the serial monitor. To configure, make sure you 
have the arduino serial monitor set to send CR at the end of each line
You will then be asked to enter your WIFI SSID, password and thingspeak key
These are stored in EEPROM
